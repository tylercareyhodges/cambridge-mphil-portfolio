# Cambridge MPhil Portfolio

This repository contains selected coursework and projects from my undergraduate studies at the University of Bristol, along with an ongoing research project.  
Itâ€™s intended to showcase my background in data analysis, statistical modelling, and programming as part of my application to the University of Cambridge MPhil in Data Intensive Science.

### Statistics 2 (Bristol)
Applied statistics module using R.  
- Coursework included hypothesis testing and data analysis.  
- The main project I remember was analysing the **Titanic dataset**, including a large-scale hypothesis test.  

Original files are no longer available.

## ðŸ‘¥ Notes
Some coursework files (notably Statistics 2 and Mathematical Programming) are missing due to loss of university account access. Summaries are included in their folders instead.
