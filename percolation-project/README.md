# Percolation Group Project

This repository contains the group project on **Percolation** completed as part of our university coursework.  
The project was developed collaboratively by me and three team members**.  

---

## ðŸ“‘ Overview
The project explores percolation theory through algorithmic simulations, combining statistical analysis with computational methods.  
We implemented and tested multiple path-finding and percolation algorithms, analysing their behaviour on random grids.
