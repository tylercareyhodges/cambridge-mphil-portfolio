# Statistics 2 (MATH20800) — Coursework Summary

This module focused on statistical inference and data analysis in R.  
Topics included estimation, likelihood, hypothesis testing, and Bayesian methods.

For coursework we mainly worked on applied data analysis.  
The project I remember most clearly was analysing the **Titanic dataset**, where we carried out hypothesis tests on survival outcomes at scale.

Unfortunately, I don’t have the original `.Rmd` files anymore, so the code and results aren’t included here.
