# Mathematical Programming (MATH20014) — Coursework Summary

This module introduced programming for mathematics using Python.  
We covered things like:
- Writing and debugging Python code  
- Implementing algorithms  
- Coursework on optimisation, cryptography, and encoding/decoding ciphers  

There were five coursework submissions plus a group project on percolation.  
Unfortunately, I no longer have access to the original coursework files after losing my Bristol university account, so the actual code isn’t included here.
